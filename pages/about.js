      <h1>hello.</h1>
      <p>
        my name is hunter. i drive a dark grey 2015 subaru wrx premium edition.
        i really like my car, i love driving and working on it, and i also
        really love to build web apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        i'm currently working on building this app with the goal of it being a
        corner on the internet for my car and my interests and life, i guess,
        but hope to turn it in to a place for others who care to share and post
        their cars and the journey that they're going on with them.
      </p>

        i know that facebook has groups, there are sites like clubwrx.net, and
        nasioc, etc. but they all have their own set of issues.
        <p>
          Facebook is great and this site will integrate with it rather than
          creating an account here, but posts on clubwrx and nasioc and such all
          decay and deteriorate after time. i plan on being a subaru owner for a
          long time, and want this space to serve as a repository for some 20
          year old kid who worked his ass off to buy a subaru wrx finally, and
          finds this site that is still present and working as he goes on to
          build things and work on his car.
        </p>
        <p>
          most importantly, this allows me to have a project to pursue to keep
          building and working on, as I am a software engineer by profession.
          So, this site is built from the ground up like any other modern web
          application.
        </p>
        <p>
          if you're interested in some of the tools and technologies that I use
          to build this site, I will have a section dedicated to that.
